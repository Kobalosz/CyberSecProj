# Cybersecurity Plan for a Company with No Existing Department

**Phase 1: Building Your Foundation (6 Months)**

* **Month 1-2: Cybersecurity Fundamentals**
    * **[Actionable]** Enroll in online courses (Coursera, edX, Cybrary) covering network security, cryptography, risk management, and security policies.
    * **[Actionable]** Read beginner-friendly books ("Hacking: The Art of Exploitation," "Cybersecurity for Dummies").
    * **[Resource]** SANS Institute's "Cyber Aces Online" (free cybersecurity curriculum)
    * **[Resource]** OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) website for secure coding practices and vulnerability information.
* **Month 3-4: Company Assessment & Developer Security**
    * **[Actionable]** Document company assets, software used, data storage practices, and any existing security measures.
    * **[Actionable]** Identify potential risks and vulnerabilities based on your growing knowledge.
    * **[Actionable]** Learn about secure coding practices, focusing on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
    * **[Actionable]** Set up a virtual "home lab" to practice with security tools like Wireshark (network analysis) and Metasploit (penetration testing - use ethically and ONLY on systems you own).
    * **[Resource]** OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list
    * **[Resource]** VirtualBox or VMware for setting up a virtual environment.
* **Month 5-6: App Development & Security by Design**
    * **[Actionable]** Choose your app development tech stack (React Native, Node.js, etc.) and begin learning secure coding practices for that stack.
    * **[Actionable]** Define the app's features and requirements: employee scheduling, geofencing, schedule optimization, and notification system.
    * **[Actionable]** Begin building a basic prototype of the app, incorporating security considerations from the start.
    * **[Resource]** FreeCodeCamp for learning web development and security concepts.
    * **[Resource]** The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Security Testing Guide

**Phase 2: Building Credibility (4 Months)**

* **Month 7-8: Internal Networking & Pilot Project**
    * **[Actionable]** Identify key personnel who handle IT-related tasks or make technology decisions.
    * **[Actionable]** Build relationships with these individuals and gauge their awareness of cybersecurity.
    * **[Actionable]** Conduct a small-scale pilot project focused on security awareness training or secure code review practices.
    * **[Actionable]** Document the results of your pilot project, highlighting any improvements or successes.
* **Month 9-10: App Pilot & External Validation**
    * **[Actionable]** Roll out the app prototype to a small group of employees for testing and feedback.
    * **[Actionable]** Gather data on app usage, identify areas for improvement, and collect user testimonials.
    * **[Actionable]** Seek external validation for your cybersecurity efforts, possibly through a limited security audit or consultation with a security expert.
    * **[Resource]**  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (provides a valuable structure for your efforts)

**Phase 3: The Cybersecurity Department Proposal (Ongoing)**

* **Month 11-12: Formal Proposal & Presentation**
    * **[Actionable]** Compile your findings, pilot project results, and app development progress into a formal proposal.
    * **[Actionable]** Clearly outline the need for a cybersecurity department, highlighting potential risks and the value of your proposed solutions.
    * **[Actionable]** Propose a phased approach, starting with a "Cybersecurity Lead" role and essential functions.
    * **[Actionable]** Include a development roadmap for the app and address its ongoing maintenance and security.
    * **[Actionable]**  Request a meeting with decision-makers to present your proposal and app. Be prepared to answer questions and address concerns.
    * **[Resource]**  SBA's Cybersecurity for Small Businesses (guides you through key considerations)

**Ongoing:**

* Continuously learn and stay updated on cybersecurity trends and best practices.
* Regularly communicate your efforts and findings to keep cybersecurity top-of-mind within the company.
* Gradually expand the scope of your cybersecurity initiatives as the company grows and resources become available.

**Key to Success:**

* **Persistence:** Building a security-conscious culture takes time and consistent effort.
* **Communication:** Clearly articulate the importance of cybersecurity to all stakeholders.
* **Collaboration:**  Seek guidance from experienced professionals and leverage free resources.
* **Passion:** Your enthusiasm for cybersecurity will be contagious and inspire others.

This comprehensive plan provides a structured approach to achieving your goal of establishing a cybersecurity department. Remember to be flexible and adapt your plan as needed based on your company's specific circumstances and feedback you receive along the way. Good luck!
