## Best Practices Throughout Development
1. Security Considerations
   - Safe handling of malware samples
   - Secure programming practices
   - Virtual machine usage for testing

2. Code Quality
   - Regular code reviews
   - Documentation
   - Version control
   - Clean code principles

3. Performance Optimization
   - Profiling and monitoring
   - Resource usage optimization
   - Scalability considerations

## Recommended Tools
1. Development
   - VS Code with Python extensions
   - Git for version control
   - Virtual environments (venv)

2. Testing
   - VirtualBox/VMware for safe testing
   - pytest for testing framework
   - cProfile for performance analysis

3. Analysis
   - IDA Free/Ghidra for reverse engineering learning
   - Process Monitor for behavior analysis
   - Wireshark for network analysis

## Safety Notes
- Always work with malware samples in isolated environments
- Use virtual machines for testing
- Never run unknown samples on production machines
- Follow proper malware handling procedures
