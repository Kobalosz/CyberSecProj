Hello! Thank you for taking interest in my big community cybersecurity project!
I work as an unarmed security guard at a local college campus to a company that the college outsources to.
I'm currently in school studying for a CS degree and have an interest in both Full-Stack development and Cyber Security, 
one thing that I constantly worry about however is how I'd go about using what I learn to make an impact in my community and with 
this projuct I think I've finally found an opportunity. The college had a major security breach 2 years ago after the network got infected with
some malware (Ransomware). This hit the college and its resources pretty hard and since have switched to using the cloud for most of their network needs.

After performing a basic security audit, I thought that maybe I could build a few programs that would support the Information Security and Network integrity of the school's systems are!
Ideally this would be the perfect leverage needed to convince the company that I work at to create a Cyber Security department (or at least a role) and I'd be able to finally get the professional
Experience that I need to grow in my tech job dreams.
